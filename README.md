# Practice-Recursion

In this program, I have implemented a couple programs that will showcase my knowledge of recursion. Below, there is a brief explanation to each of the programs:

1. Cannonballs - Counts the number of cannonballs a pyramid structure will have when given an inputted height 

2. Palindrome - The program will take in a string and determine whether the string is a palindrome. 

3. Balanced - The program will take in a string of parenthesis, brackets, and braces and determine whether there is a balanced amount of open and closed. 

4. Substring - Given a string, print out all of the possible substrings. 

5. Binary - Print the inputted number in binary.

6. AddToSum - The program will take in an array of integers and a target sum and print out a subset of integers from the array that will add up to the target (if possible). 

7. NumberSubsetSum - It will return the total number of subsets that add up to the target sum.
